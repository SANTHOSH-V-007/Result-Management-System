The Result Management System is a
sophisticated web application designed to
streamline the management and display of
student results in an educational institution.
By leveraging the MERN stack—comprising
MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—
this system provides a robust, user-friendly,
and scalable solution tailored for both
administrators and students. The core
objective of this application is to facilitate the
efficient uploading, processing, and
presentation of various types of student
marks, making the entire process seamless
and accurate.

The admin panel is designed to offer
maximum flexibility and control to
administrators. Admins can log in to a secure
dashboard where they can manage multiple
tabs corresponding to different categories of
student marks, such as attendance marks,
project review marks, assessment marks,
project submission marks, and LinkedIn post
marks. Each tab allows the admin to upload
data via Excel sheets, ensuring that bulk data
can be processed quickly and accurately. This
not only reduces the administrative burden
but also minimizes the risk of manual errors.
